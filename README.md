# üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

If you forget to lock your computer and your friends/coworkers often come to your computer to do evil stuff.. like for an example at my work. If anyone forgets to lock their computer we will open Outlook and send an email to every employee that we offer them a free cake! So to protect myself i had to create a shortcut to a fake Outlook file that instead lock the computer for me! And now you can do it aswell :D
